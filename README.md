# WinSpy - Window Information Tool

This is a fork of Alguimist's WinSpy code, which can originally be found [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=28220).

I've made changes so that I can trigger the window capture via a hotkey (F1).  
This allows window control search of popups that disappear when no longer hovered on.
